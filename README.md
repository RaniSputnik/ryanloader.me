# Portfolio

Repo for my personal portfolio, accessible available at [ryanloader.me](http://ryanloader.me/).

I host this site using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) for about ~55c a month. I use [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) for DNS and Github provides the hosting.
