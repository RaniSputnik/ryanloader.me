# Portfolio

Repo for my personal portfolio, accessible available at [ryanloader.me](http://ryanloader.me/).

I host the site on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) for about ~55c a month. I make use of the [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) service for content storage and distribution as described in [this article](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) and [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) for DNS.
